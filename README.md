# hello-world
This is a newly created repository for the purpose of learning even more about git and github. 
So, now I have created a new branch in which I am able to write some other stuff for this README file. It is not as useful as the other line, but still - I find it refreshing to work with github also. 
Let me tell you a bit about myself: I am from Denmark and I aim to be better at Javascript and HTML5 game development.
